# Cluegetter allows to use multiple configurations of ClueGetter

# easy correlation (e.g. track a message by message id). The quota
# configuration is instance specific.
#
# A typical use case would be to have several MTAs each with a
# dedicated role (submission, mx, outbound). One would then define
# an instance type of 'submission', 'mx' and 'outbound'. All MTAs
# with the same role would generally use the same instance identifier.

# An instance identifier must be present in the 'instance' table
# prior to starting ClueGetter. ClueGetter will not start if the
# configured instance is not present in the database.

# clients will get to see an error when sending their mail as well as
# the reason as to why their email was blocked.
